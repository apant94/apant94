### About me
I wish to implement cool and useful projects and improve them. 
Firstly, as the owner of clothing brand, I love to make something beautiful and practical with my own hands, and secondly, I have already brought my brand online.
After this experience, I became a fan of the unlimited possibilities of web development. 
Most importantly, what I like the most is to see the result of my work, so the frontend is my perfect match.
